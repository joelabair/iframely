# Optional API parameters


You may configure API in [your API settings](https://iframely.com/settings). Plus send filters in your query-string for each API call individually. If not given with an API call, your defaults will be used. If you haven't set up your preferences, the cloud-wide settings will be used.

For paid accounts, we can also customize what embeds you get for most individual publishers. See examples at the bottom.

## For individual API calls


All below parameters are optional. If not given, you will still receive all relevant information in `rel` attributes of [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) (not in [oEmbed](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) though).


 - `iframe=true` or `iframe=1` - activates [URL shortener](https://iframely.com/docs/url-shortener) and will return the hosted iframes or [summary cards](https://iframely.com/docs).

 - `lazy=1` will activate [lazy-loading](https://iframely.com/docs/lazy-load) when Iframely returns a [smart iFrame](https://iframely.com/docs/iframes).

 - `omit_script=1` will [exclude embed.js](https://iframely.com/docs/lazy-load#omit-script) from HTML code, if you load it yourself.

 - `autoplay=true` or `1` - will give preference to `autoplay` media and will try to return it as primary `html`. Check for `autoplay` in primary `rel` to verify.

 - `ssl=true` or `1` - will return only embeds that can be used under HTTPs without active SSL mixed-content warnings (images and mp4 videos trigger only passive warnings and thus will pass this check).

 - `html5=true` or `1`- will return only embeds that can be viewed on mobile devices or desktops without Flash plugin installed.

 - `media=true` or `1`- "prefer media-only". For some publishers, Iframely knows status-like `app` embeds AND simple media, such as photos or video. This option will make Iframely return actual media in the `html` field instead of branded embeds.  It affects, for example, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur, Pinterest (for videos), etc.

 - `maxwidth=` in pixels will return only embeds that do not exceed this width. It affects the rare cases of fixed-width embeds as in most cases Iframely gives the responsive embed codes. However, this parameter is important for Facebook posts and Pinterest, as it is passed into embed code of those providers to adjust its width.

 - `origin=` - optional tag text value that will help you later search links in your dashboard. It represents the hashtag  E.g. project or chat room name, category, app, if you got several, etc.

 - `align=left` - for cloud version, will skip default center aligning of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other app embeds. 

 - `callback` - name of a JavaScript function, if youâ€™d like response to be wrapped as JSONP.


Also, for [oEmbed API](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) only:

 - there's `format=xml` parameter - if you'd like to get your oEmbed as XML.

 - But no `autoplay` parameter. oEmbed never returns the media that autoplays. However, If you're wrapping embed codes with [smart iFrames](https://iframely.com/docs/iFrames) using API with `iframe=true`, the autoplay media will be returned with a [special card](https://iframely.com/docs/widgets).


## For individual embeds publishers

Number of publishers give different embedding options. By default, Iframely provides embeds that we believe is the best fit for most common use case. But you, of course, may need it differently.

In that case, Iframely team can configure the exact embeds you like for your favourite publishers. Since it's a manual process, we offer it for paid accounts only. [Send us an email](mailto:support@iframely.com) and we'll start from there. Most adjustments take less than 30 mins to manually turn around.

Examples of what people often request: 

 - Basic image or video instead of branded embeds for Flickr or Imgur, or Instagram, or Tumblr
 - Different player UI for YouTube and Vimeo
 - "Classic" player for SoundCloud
 - Twitter: center or not, include media or not, show parent message, etc.
 - Facebook: for videos, show entire status rather than just a video
 - Show user message for Instagram embeds
 - Giphy: disable branded GIF player and use Iframely's [friendly GIFs](/docs/gifs) instead
 - Turn on support of Twitter videos (experimental)
 - Bandcamp players
 - Etc.
