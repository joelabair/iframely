### 2015.10.19, Version 0.9.0

This version brings significant changes and improvements.

1. Better way to customize individual plugins, for example: 

 - Basic image or video instead of branded embeds for Flickr or Imgur, or Instagram, or Tumblr
 - Different player UI for YouTube and Vimeo
 - "Classic" player for SoundCloud
 - Twitter: center or not, include media or not, show parent message, etc.
 - Facebook: for videos, show entire status rather then just a video
 - Show user message for Instagram embeds
 - Giphy: disable branded GIF player and use plain GIF instead
 - Turn on support of Twitter videos (experimental)

See sample config file for ways to customize. *Heads up:* `twitter.status` in config was renamed to just `twitter`. 


2. Caching improvements

 - We return the cache of source data such as meta and oEmbed or API calls. This way during the updates or whitelist changes Iframely won't create a tsunami of outbound traffic if there is a fresh copy of source in its cache. 
 - Twitter plugin has been completely re-written to properly address API calls caching and also nicely handle of errors 417 (i.e. Twitter's rate-limit reached)

3. Domains 

 - Number of improvements in existing domain plugins. Twitter Videos, better Imgur galleries, etc.
 - New domains: Wikipedia (proper thumbnail and meta), IGN, Dispatch, CBS News, Google Calendars.

4. Update dependencies. 

 - Please run `npm update` as package dependencies have changed. 
 - If you run into `../lib/kerberos.h:5:27: fatal error: gssapi/gssapi.h: No such file or directory`  - see [this comment](https://github.com/itteco/iframely/commit/991406b37da76f0a27501611702cb7a414136a6b)

- Option to send params for individual oEmbed providers (`ADD_OEMBED_PARAMS` in sample config)
- General config option to group Iframely JSON's links by rel by default (`GROUP_LINKS`)
- `media=1` optional query string API param that will make Iframely try to return actual media. Ex: Instagram MP4 video instead of status embed

### 2015.06.08, Version 0.8.6

Changes to existing publishers:

- Added Imgur’s new `app` embeds

- All Google parsers: properly handle private content and return status 403 if login is required

### 2015.05.07, Version 0.8.5

- It may be the same key you have for new Google Maps, yet copy it in other option.


### 2015.05.06, Version 0.8.3


- New Google Maps plugin to support current URL scheme (Google finally stopped re-directing our user-agent to their classic URLs)
- Google Maps require API key: get it [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide#api_key) and configure as `providerOptions.google.maps_key` - see sample local config

### 2015.03.04, Version 0.8.0

*Heads up:* 

Starting from this version, the minimal Node.js version required for Iframely is 0.10.22. We had to make a choice to either support latest Node.js or earlier version due to incompatible libraries dependenices. Please, run 'npm update' to update libraries. Unfortunatelly, update likely won't work if your Node is earlier than 0.10.22.


- Instagram status JS embeds with rel `app`
- Tumblr status JS embeds with rel `app` (beware: embeds don't work with SSL)
- International domains for Pinterest
- Google custom maps
- YouTube playlists and timed embeds
- Google+ posts for international usernames. Plus, properly exclude posts in groups
- Medium stories will now have JS embeds too
- Fix issues with caching of JSONP requests
- Number of fixes in various other plugins
